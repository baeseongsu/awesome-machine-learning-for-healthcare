# awesome-machine-learning-for-healthcare

Welcome to my personal repository, a curated collection of cutting-edge research at the intersection of machine learning and healthcare.
As an AI researcher with a strong interest in healthcare applications, I've compiled this repository to showcase innovative works mostly in natural language processing (NLP) and multimodal learning within the healthcare domain.
While this collection reflects my personal research focus, it aims to serve as a valuable resource for anyone passionate about leveraging machine learning for healthcare.
I welcome contributions and discussions, so feel free to share ideas or suggest papers!
